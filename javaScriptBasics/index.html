            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platfrom, object-oriented scripting language.JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScriptlives inside a host enviroment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these envirmonets to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul>
                    <li><p><b><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_link_all" target="_blank"> Variable Declaration</a></b>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with cofee, the cup holds the coffee a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">var x;</span></p></li>
                    <li><p><b><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Variable Assignment</a></b> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee pured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">var x = 10;</span></p></li>
                    <li><p><b><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Data Types</a></b> Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span style = "color:purple;font-weight:bold">true</span> or <span style = "color:purple;font-weight:bold">false;</span> null - <span style = "color:purple;font-weight:bold">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span style = "color:purple;font-weight:bold">42</span> or <span style = "color:purple;font-weight:bold">3.14159;</span> String - <span style = "color:purple;font-weight:bold">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>Array - <span style = "color:purple;font-weight:bold">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span style = "color:purple;font-weight:bold">{fisrt_name:'jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span></p> </li>
                    <li><p><b><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Conditionals</a></b> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. you can use conditionals statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false: <span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">else</span> we execute this block of code;</p></li>
                    <li><p><b><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Loops</a></b> there are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</p></li>
                    <li><p><b><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Functions</a></b> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a dest from Ikea, we open up the instruction manuaal and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! we finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</p></li>
